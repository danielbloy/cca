# Python

To avoid having to setup a local Python development environment, a good way to
get started with Python is to use an online IDE. These can be used from pretty
much any device including Windows PCs, Macs, Linux, Raspberry Pi, Android tablets
or iPads. At my Code Club I use [replit](https://replit.com/) which has a free tier.
See the [replit](replit.md) guide to get started.

[MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) also allows you to write your games
in Python.

## Books

There are a huge range of resources out there for Learning Python and it can be daunting
for beginners to identify which are worth their investment in time or money. I recommend
the following resources:

[Python in easy steps](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-easy-steps-2nd-covers/dp/1840788127) is a concise and low cost overview of the language and the book
I use with my learners during Python sessions. The Python challenges I have written contain 
references to the relevant sections in this book.

The following books are all written by Al Sweigart and available free on his website https://inventwithpython.com.
Print versions are available direct from the publisher or Amazon for a fee. There are a range of books covering
several topics and 4 that I recommend for Python are:

[Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/)

[Python Programming Exercises, Gently Explained](https://inventwithpython.com/pythongently/)

[Making Games with Python & Pygame](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/)

[The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/)

## Challenges

The following materials are designed for self-directed learning once comfortable with writing Python
scripts. I recommend only starting the challenges once you have completed Modules 1 and 2 above. Each
of the challenges contain references to the book [Python in easy steps](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-easy-steps-2nd-covers/dp/1840788127) and I recommend purchasing a copy (though it is not essential).

1 - [Guess the number](python/challenges/guess_the_number.md)

2 - [Higher or lower](python/challenges/higher_or_lower.md)

## Coding Games with Pygame Zero & Python

The following materials are provided freely online by Richard Smith and take the reader
from the fundamentals of Python to writing games using Pygame Zero. The website is
available [here](https://electronstudio.github.io/pygame-zero-book/README.html).

4 - [Drawing graphics](https://electronstudio.github.io/pygame-zero-book/chapters/graphics.html)

5 - [Arcade games](https://electronstudio.github.io/pygame-zero-book/chapters/simple_games.html)

6 - [Improving your games](https://electronstudio.github.io/pygame-zero-book/chapters/more_graphics.html)

7 - [More advanced games](https://electronstudio.github.io/pygame-zero-book/chapters/more_games.html)

8 - [Tutorial: Chase game](https://electronstudio.github.io/pygame-zero-book/chapters/chase.html)

9 - [Tutorial: Maze game](https://electronstudio.github.io/pygame-zero-book/chapters/maze.html)

10 - [Tutorial: Shooting game](https://electronstudio.github.io/pygame-zero-book/chapters/shooter.html)

11 - [Tutorial: Race game](https://electronstudio.github.io/pygame-zero-book/chapters/race.html)

## More Games with Pygame Zero

I have written the following Pygame materials which are designed to be followed after
working through the Code Club Python materials. The reader should have a moderate grasp
of Python. All of these materials have been designed to work with the online programming
IDE [replit](https://replit.com/).

1 - [Muncher](python/pygame/muncher.md) (Pac-Man)

2 - [Smash](python/pygame/smash.md) (Breakout), beta

2a - Classes and inheritance, coming

3 - Memory (Simon Says), coming

4 - [Pairs](python/pygame/pairs.md), coming

5 - [Bugs](python/pygame/bugs.md) (Whac-A-Mole), coming

5b - Improving collision detection, coming

6 - [Aliens](python/pygame/aliens.md) (Galaxian), coming

7 - Paint, coming

8 - Stack (Tetris), coming

9 - Rocks (Missile Command), coming

10 - Fireworks, coming

11 - Jumper (Mario Bros), coming

12 - Toad (Frogger), coming

13 - OXO, coming

14 - Race (Pole Position), coming

15 - Maze, coming

16 - [Invaders](python/pygame/invaders.md) (Space Invaders), coming

17 - Collision (Geometry Wars/Asteroids), coming

18 - Concrete (Cement Factory), coming

19 - Sandwiches (Burger Time), coming

20 - Worm (Snake), coming

## MakeCode Arcade Python

[MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) also allows you to write your games
in Python (though it is more limited than Replit and not as mature as the MakeCode
Arcade TypeScript tooling). The materials that I initially produced highlighted some
issues with the early access Python tooling so we stopped using it. In time, I'm sure
the tooling will mature enough for us to use it again. The materials are marked as
alpha, beta or final based on the quality/stage of development of the material. The
alpha materials will be first stage PDFs, beta are updated web based materials but not
neccessarily battle tested in the Coding Club yet so may contain errors and final will
be the tested materials.

1 - [OXO](img/arcade/python/1-oxo-python.pdf), alpha

2 - [Invaders](img/arcade/python/2-invaders-python.pdf), alpha

3 - [Smash](img/arcade/python/3-smash-python.pdf), alpha

4 - Frog, coming

5 - Muncher, coming
