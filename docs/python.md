# Python

To avoid having to setup a local Python development environment, a good way to
get started with Python is to use an online IDE. These can be used from pretty
much any device including Windows PCs, Macs, Linux, Raspberry Pi, Android tablets
or iPads. At my Code Club I use [replit](https://replit.com/) which has a free tier.
See the [replit](replit.md) guide to get started.

## Books
There are a huge range of resources out there for Learning Python and it can be daunting
for beginners to identify which are worth their investment in time or money. I recommend
the following resources:

[Python in easy steps](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-easy-steps-2nd-covers/dp/1840788127) is a concise and low cost overview of the language and the book
I use with my learners during Python sessions. The Python challenges I have written contain 
references to the relevant sections in this book.

The following books are all written by Al Sweigart and available free on his website https://inventwithpython.com.
Print versions are available direct from the publisher or Amazon for a fee. There are a range of books covering
several topics and 4 that I recommend for Python are:

[Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/)

[Python Programming Exercises, Gently Explained](https://inventwithpython.com/pythongently/)

[Making Games with Python & Pygame](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/)

[The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/)

## Challenges

The following materials are designed for self-directed learning once comfortable with writing Python
scripts. I recommend only starting the challenges once you have completed Modules 1 and 2 above. Each
of the challenges contain references to the book [Python in easy steps](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-easy-steps-2nd-covers/dp/1840788127) and I recommend purchasing a copy (though it is not essential).

1 - [Guess the number](python/challenges/guess_the_number.md)

2 - [Higher or lower](python/challenges/higher_or_lower.md)
