Hello and welcome! Why have I started this site? I run a Code Club in a library in rural Norfolk in the UK which I thoroughly love. One of the biggest challenges I've found is in having suitable materials for the children to work through; particularly when delivering the sessions on library computers that are completeley locked down (and old). All of the lessons I deliver are done using tools that can be run in a browser on a relatively low specification computer. Also, the materials and tools I use are free to minimise costs.

Even though there are plenty of materials out there, they are often hard to find in the ocean of the world wide web. I have also found that some platforms are better supported than others and the quality of materials available varies a lot.

This site is a curated list of quality materials from other sources that I use in my sessions and some that I have produced myself to help you on your coding journey. The materials are presented in a structured pathway to help you develop your skills in a progressive way.

My recommended pathways are:

* Beginning ([Blocks](blocks.md))
* Progressing ([Python](python.md))
* Advanced (CircuitPython)

## Beginning ([Blocks](blocks.md))

Start with [Blocks](blocks.md) based programming such as [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/). This provides the easiest transition into coding as it is very visual and interactive allowing you to develop your skills.

As your skills develop, you can also explore the [BBC micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/) which offers blocks based programming and even [MakeCode Mindstorms](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/).

## Progressing ([Python](python.md))

As your programs become more advanced, blocks based programming can become more challenging to use. At this point you will want to transition from blocks to text based programming. The best language to use to make this transition is [Python](python.md). Whilst [Python](python.md) is not supported on the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) platform, it is supported on the [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/), [MakeCode Mindstorms](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/) and [BBC micro:bit](https://python.microbit.org/v/3) platforms as well as the [replit](https://replit.com/) IDE.

## Advanced (CircuitPython)

Now is time to move onto the Raspberry Pi Pico with CircuitPython...
