# Blocks

Beginners should start their coding journey with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and then
progress on to [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/).

## Scratch

The scratch sessions in my Code Club are built around the materials provided by [Code Club](https://codeclub.org). I recommend working through the activities in order. Depending on experience, each
activity will take between 45 and 90 minutes.

## Invasion of the Alien Ducks

[Errata for Invasion of the Alien Ducks](errata.md).

This is the first material that I've produced which is suitable for wide distribution. It's a MakeCode Arcade Blocks worksheet
and is suitable for anyone that has some experience of blocks programming. The PDF is available [here](img/arcade/blocks/stage-3/ducks/ducks-blocks.pdf)
and is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. To view a copy of this license, visit
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/>. The materials are designed to be used in printed form. As this is over 40 pages long and image heavy, I have published it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Invasion-Alien-Ducks-Adventures-MakeCode/dp/B0BZC3BTFD/) where you can buy a printed copy for Â£4.50.
