# Summary

The published mkdocs site can be found here: https://danielbloy.github.io/cca/.

Why does this GitHub project exist? Recent changes to the Internet screening in
the Library where I run my Code Club has resulted in blocking my
[Code Club Adventures](http://codeclubadventures.com/) website that contains
this content. Annoyingly it has also blocked some functionality in the Replit
IDE used for the PyGame activities. Thankfully, the GitHub documentation pages
are not blocked so I'm using this as a stop gap until I can get a proper fix.
